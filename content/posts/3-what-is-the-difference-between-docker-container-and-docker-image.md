Today I learned the difference between **image** and **container** in [Docker][1]. An **image** is a template that can be used to create a container while **container** is the instances of said Docker images. The container is the one that runs your application.

To explain it in *cake* term, **image** is the recipe of the cake and **container** is the cake itself. You can create multiple cakes based on the same recipe.

To see all the images available, you can run the following:
```
$~ docker images
```

and to see the container that's currently running, you can run:
```
$~ docker ps
```

or if you want to see the list of available containers, run:
```
$~ docker ps -a
```

That's it. 🎂
