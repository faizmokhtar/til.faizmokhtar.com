`smerge` is a command line tools for [Sublime Merge][1]. To make this tools available in your command line, you have to symlink it. Here's the command on how to do it for macOS:

```
 ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Merge.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/smerge" /usr/local/bin/smerge
``` 

That's it. After this, you can easily browse your repo in Sublime Merge just by typing `smerge` in your CLI.

For Windows or Linux, you can check Sublime Merge's [docs][2].
