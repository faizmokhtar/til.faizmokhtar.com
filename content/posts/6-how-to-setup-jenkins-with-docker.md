Here's how to setup [Jenkins][1] with [Docker][2]

1. Run the following commands in your terminal

````
docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
docker run --detach --publish 8080:8080 --volume
jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
````

2. The above command will generate a password. Copy said password

3. Open `localhost:8080` and paste in the password

4. Setup your user account and install suggested plugins.

That's it!
