I learned a command from my senior(Joseph) this week that can print all available build settings available in your Xcode project. 

This is super helpful when you have to write a custom run script or when you have to edit a 3rd party library install script (like what I experienced this week 😭)

Anyway, to print the list run the following command in your project root:

````
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -project SampleApp.xcodeproj
````

Or if you're using workspace, use the following command. The `-scheme` have to be defined for it to work.

````
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace -scheme 'SampleApp'
````

If you want the list of build settings that are specific to a certain configuration, ie: `Release` or `Debug`

````
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace -scheme 'SampleApp' -configuration Release
````

Finally, to make it easier for you to go through the whole list, you can pipe the output to a text file. For example

````
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -workspace SampleApp.xcworkspace -scheme 'SampleApp' -configuration Release | tee ~/Desktop/build.txt
````

Then you can file the generated files at `~/Desktop/build.txt`

That's it. Hope you will find this useful when debugging.
